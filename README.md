## An accessible portable newsroom system and publishing node.

Omoluabi is an accessible, portable newsroom system designed to help independent publishers reclaim control over how they create, publish, and sustain their work.

Built to be self-hostable and deployable on low-cost hardware, Omoluabi functions as a portable publishing node. Omoluabi-News serves as the first live implementation of this model.

The system integrates AI assistance with clear human oversight, prioritizing editorial accountability, accessibility, and long-term autonomy from platform dependence.

Omoluabi is designed to support interconnected deployments, enabling stories to be shared across independent nodes without central platform control.

## Core Principles

- Editorial control with transparent AI assistance  
- Accessibility-centered design  
- Portable, self-hosted infrastructure  
- Durable autonomy from platform dependence  
- Support for interconnected nodes  

## Status

Prototype development and architectural documentation in progress.
